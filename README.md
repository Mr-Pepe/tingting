# TingTing - Boost your listening comprehension

TingTing helps you to improve your listening comprehension in a few easy steps:
* Copy text into the app as a reference
* Load audio from a file or generate it from the text you copied
* Transcribe what you hear
* Let TingTing compare your writing to the reference and tell you exactly where you got things wrong


TingTing uses the [Needleman-Wunsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) to compare the self written transcript to the original.
